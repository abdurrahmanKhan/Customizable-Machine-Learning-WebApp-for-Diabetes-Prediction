# Customizable-Machine-Learning-WebApp-for-Diabetes-Prediction

An interactive app to help you utilise the power of machine learning with just some clicks.
This application is for both 'Domain Experts' and 'People with other area of expertise'.
This application provides you the components to customize the hyperparameters for the machine learning algorithms of your own choice.
Additional feature of this application is that if you are a person with no knowldge of computers or Machine learning, this app provides you suggestions of the best hyperparameters which you can use them to use machine learning models.
These suggestions are a result of a GirdSearchCV which an for 5 cross-validations in for each machine leaning model to produce the best parameters.

You can even give custom input to this application and it will produce the result giving out the probability of having diabetes based on the inputs provided.
Inputs are - Insulin, Gluscose and the restpective attributes which are needed to define diabetes which can be found by having a blood test at your local diagnostic centre.
